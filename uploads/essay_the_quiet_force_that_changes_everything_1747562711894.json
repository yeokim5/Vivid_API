  "section1": "Love is often misunderstood. We chase it in grand gestures, in perfect partners, in fleeting highs that mimic its warmth—but love, real love, is quieter than we think. It’s not just the flutter in your chest or the fireworks in your mind. It’s in the stillness.",

  "section3": "It’s not “you complete me. ” It’s freedom. It’s saying, I see you—flawed, growing, real—and I choose to stand with you.",

  "section4": "Love makes room for imperfection. It asks for honesty, not perfection; depth, not drama. It’s in the mother who stays up through the night just to make sure her child breathes easy.",

  "section5": "It’s in the friend who listens when you have nothing pretty to say. It’s in the stranger who smiles without needing a reason. Love doesn’t always shout.",

  "section8": "The way you see the world. Because love is not weakness. It is the greatest strength a human can hold.",
  "section8_image_url": "",
  "section9": "It dissolves hate, bridges divides, and heals wounds that logic alone cannot reach. It transforms not through force, but through grace. To love, truly, is to stand at the edge of yourself and say, I’m willing to step beyond me for you.",
