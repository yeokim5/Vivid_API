  "section1": "In the rush of daily life, we often measure our worth by achievements, possessions, and how others perceive us. But what if the true value of life lies not in what we gain, but in how we see?",

  "section3": "Consider this: two people can walk the same path—face the same struggles, same losses, same joys—and yet one can be broken while the other finds growth. Why?",
  "section3_image_url": "",
  "section4": "It’s not about avoiding pain, but embracing it as part of the story. We spend so much energy trying to fix or escape discomfort, yet it’s discomfort that deepens our capacity for empathy, resilience, and gratitude.",
